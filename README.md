Android library for build QrCodes with inside images.
===============================

Usage Maven Repo
----------------

I've uploaded the `.aar` in my maven repository. You only need to add following lines to your `build.gradle` to add the dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'br.fgr.customqrcode:customqrcode:1.0'
}
```
